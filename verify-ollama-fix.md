# Ollama Integration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Model Detection**: The Ollama example now automatically detects available models instead of defaulting to "llama2"
2. **Better Error Messages**: When a model is not found, the provider now gives clear instructions on how to install it
3. **Cleaner Logging**: Removed verbose logging prefixes by configuring SimpleConsole with appropriate filters

## Changes Made

### OllamaProvider.cs
- Added better error handling for 404 errors with specific messages about missing models
- Improved error messages to include instructions for installing models

### examples/Ollama/Program.cs
- Modified `ShowAvailableModels` to return the first available model
- Added automatic model selection when OLLAMA_MODEL environment variable is not set
- Updated model comparison to use actually available models
- Configured logging to hide HTTP client and provider debug logs

### examples/AzureOpenAI/Program.cs
- Applied consistent logging configuration
- All output now goes through the logger instead of Console.WriteLine

## Testing

Run the Ollama example with your available models:
```bash
dotnet run --project examples/Ollama
```

The example will:
1. Detect available models (gpt-oss:20b, phi4:latest in your case)
2. Use the first available model if OLLAMA_MODEL is not set
3. Run all examples with the selected model
4. Display clean output without verbose logging prefixes

## Configuration

The logging now uses `AddSimpleConsole` with these settings:
- `TimestampFormat = ""` - No timestamps
- `SingleLine = true` - Compact output
- Filters to hide HTTP client and provider debug logs

This provides clean, readable output while still using the proper logging infrastructure.
